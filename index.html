      <h1>Personas and Storyboarding</h1>
      <p>
          To get a better sense of user experiences, I decided to engage in a classic UX task. I visited the 
          local laundromat to observe real users interacting with the controls on a washer.
          I stepped into the shoes of the users (in the metaphorical sense, of course). I interviewed some of the users
          about their experiences, created personas based on these users, and illustrated a storyboard for one of my
          personas.

      <h2>Annotated Sketch and Description of Interface</h2>
      <div class="persona-item">
        <img src="./interface-sketch.jpg" alt="washer-interface">
        <p>
            This commercial washer interface features a collection of buttons and light-up indicators to help users achieve a 
            particular washer cycle setting that is appropriate for washing their dirty clothes. Some of its key interactive 
            components include buttons for soil levels, cycle types, and temperature options. Pressing a button for each row in 
            the selection interface (soil level, cycle type, temperature options) results in a unique washer cycle setting that is made 
            visible to the user via indicator lights. Other components include indicators for inserting coins/card, door status, 
            wash/rinse/spin status. There is also a start button that serves to initiate the wash cycle.

      <h2>Observations and Interview Summaries</h2>
      <h3>Key Observations</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Most users attempted to press locations on the interface that were not buttons, particularly the rinse and spin images</li>
        <li>One user repeatedly pressed the ‘start’ button since the washer was not starting. The insert coins/card indicator was on, but did not seem to grab the user’s attention</li>
        <li>Most users pressed the buttons in an order that was not top-down (cycle -> temp -> soil as opposed to soil -> cycle -> temp)</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Interview Questions</h3>
      <ol>
          <li>What was your experience like using this particular washer?</li>
          <li>What was your first impression of the washer controls?</li>
          <li>Where do you start when setting the washer controls?</li>
          <li>Were you able to find what you were looking for when setting the washer controls?</li>
          <li>How long did it take you to set the washer controls?</li>
          <li>Was this shorter, longer, or about the same compared to what you expected?</li>
          <li>Were these washer controls easy or difficult to understand?</li>
          <li>What, if anything, would you change about the water controls?</li>
          <li>If you have anything to say that wasn’t asked, please feel free to share!</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Summary of Responses</h3>
      <ul>
          <li>All users had a positive initial impression of the washer interface, reporting that it seemed ‘intuitive’</li>
          <li>However, most users expressed disappointment that they were unable to find buttons to fine-tune/add rinse and spin cycles that would help wash clothes better and reduce drying time</li>
          <li>Most users stated that they took longer than expected to set the washer controls since they were searching for such buttons to modulate rinse and spin levels</li>
          <li>Users seemed to be in agreement that buttons to modulate rinse and spin levels would be a great addition</li>
          <li>Most users also suggested a flashing indicator for the insert coin/change light-up as opposed to a static indicator</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
          What I took away from this classic UX task was both interesting and rewarding. I realized the importance
          of observing user behavior in understanding the user experience. I learned that interviews
          offer some insights into the motivations and goals of each user. But to get a more holistic
          and accurate perspective, it is also important to analyze user behavior. It was surprising to
          unravel some of the design flaws in a washer that initially seemmed completely intutiive.
